# KingsCup

King's Cup or the Ring of Fire was a popular game I used to play in college. I wanted to digitize it and allow others to play if they do not have a deck of cards, but do have a computer to run Python. The rules of the game are simple and can be found online, but this version closely resembles the rules I used to play by. Please be conscious of those around you and DRINK RESPONSIBLY!
